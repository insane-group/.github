[**INSANE Group**](https://insane.iit.demokritos.gr/) is a **research lab**, a knowledge-sharing hub, and a key agent enabling the interaction between Artificial Intelligence and Physical Sciences.

AI today is both data-hungry and energy-intensive. In response to the current challenges of the real world, our INSANE vision is to form a new AI paradigm -one that is data-lean, knowledge-informed, explainable, frugal, transferable and cost-aware.
